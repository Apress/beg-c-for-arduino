  /*
  Alternate Blink
  Turns on one LED on for one second while the other is off, then reverses the LEDs for 1 second, repeatedly.

// Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
// give it a name:
int led1 = 13;
int led2 = 12;	// This is for the second LED

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {                
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(led1, OUTPUT);     
  pinMode(led2, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led1, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  digitalWrite(led2, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(led1, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  digitalWrite(led2, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
